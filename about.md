## John Wilger ##

John lives in a rural town outside of Portland, Oregon—with his wife,
their five children, and two dogs—where he enjoys [racing his
bicycle][obra] (though, admittedly, not very fast) for [Team
Oregon][team-o], camping, hiking, cooking delicious food, and playing
games with his kids.

John has been developing software professionally since 1999, and
managing teams of developers since 2010.  He is a proponent of agile
software development, although [his definition of agile][be-agile] is
not limited to any specific process.

## Front Matter ##

This website is mainly composed using [Markdown][markdown] and
(primarily) [vim][vim], published with [Jekyll][jekyll], and hosted on
[GitHub][github]. You are welcome to have a peak at [the site's source
code][github-repo], but keep in mind that all of the site's posts and
page content is _Copyright ©2009 John Wilger, All Rights Reserved_.

The layout and color scheme is just a hacked up version of Jekyll's
default theme; I should probably overhaul it a some point, because it's
kind of a mess.
