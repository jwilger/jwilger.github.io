I started using [tmux][tmux] recently after a) I was informed that GNU screen is
basically an outdated POS, and b) an [excellent book][tmuxbook] on the subject
was published. I'm glad to have made the switch, as tmux is a wonderful
improvement over screen. However, on OSX, I found that the `pbcopy` and
`pbpaste` commands (among other things) would no longer work from within a tmux
session.

After a bit of searching, I found [this post][rtoc] that explains how to make
things right again.

TL;DR:

``` sh run this
brew install reattach-to-user-namespace
```

``` sh add this to ~/.tmux.conf
# Reattach to user namespace so that clipboard integration with OSX works again
set-option -g default-command "reattach-to-user-namespace -l zsh"
```

Obviously, replace `zsh` above with whatever you use for your shell.
