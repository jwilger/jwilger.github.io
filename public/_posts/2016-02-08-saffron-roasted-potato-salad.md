Last Thursday, my dad was visiting from Ohio (we haven't seen him since
the wedding over a year ago), so we hosted a big get-together with the
whole family (my Dad, Amber, our five kids, plus my ex, her husband and
their other three kids). The kids all wanted me to make my fried
chicken, which I did, but I also needed to throw together some kind of
vegetable dish, which I didn't think about until we were at the grocery
store that afternoon. I knew I wanted something that wouldn't be too
hands-on while it was cooking, because I was going to be busy making the
chicken, so I decided to do a roasted root vegetable dish and just
grabbed produce on a whim to be included.

The result was absolutely amazing. I served it as a hot side-dish with
dinner that night, and also discovered the next day―due to being too
lazy to warm up anything for lunch―that it performs just as well (maybe
even better) as a cold potato salad.

## Ingredients ##

* 2 medium yams
* 2 golden Yukon potatoes
* 2 red potatoes
* 4 carrots
* 1 red bell pepper
* 1 green bell pepper
* 1 head of broccoli
* 8-12 cloves of garlic
* leaves from 4-6 sprigs of fresh thyme (discard stems)
* 1 pinch of saffron
* 2 tbs salt
* 1.5 tsp course-ground black pepper
* 1/3 cup olive oil

## Directions ##

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.

2. Clean all vegetables, leaving the skins on the potatoes and carrots
   (but removing any "eyes").

3. Chop potatoes and carrots into 1-2" chunks.

4. Remove stems and seeds from bell peppers and cut into 1/2" strips.

5. Cut broccoli into florets (discard or repurpose the larger stems).

6. Combine all ingredients *except for the oil* in a roasting pan,
   tossing to evenly distribute seasoning.

7. Add olive oil and toss to coat.

8. Roast in oven for 60-90 minutes until potatoes are fork-tender. Stir
   every 10 minutes during cooking to redistribute oil and seasoning
   that settles to the bottom of the pan.

Makes approximately 10 servings.
