One of the benefits of riding/racing with [Team Oregon][TO] is having access to
some pretty sweet deals from [our awesome sponsors][TOS]. In particular, I just
ordered a couple of my favorite products to help fuel my training rides this
spring:

* [Nuun Active][NA]: Effervescent tabs that add electrolytes to your water
  without adding (much) additional sugars, etc. I love having my electrolytes be
  separate from my fuel, because the balance that I want between the two is
  going to vary a lot depending on the specifics of the ride/event and the
  weather that day. There are a few companies out there with products like this,
  but Nuun is the only one I've used that manages to avoid making my water taste
  like it has a bunch of unnatural chemicals in it (at least with my favorite
  strawberry-lemonade flavor.)

* [Honey Stinger Waffles][HW]: Honey Stinger has a range of products to help
  replenish calories during a ride. I just ordered a box of my favorite: the
  chocolate waffles. What I like about these is that they have a little more
  substance to them than a gel---which keeps my stomach happy on long, endurance
  rides this time of year---but they are still moist enough to be easy to chew
  and swallow without needing to take a sip from your bottle after every bite.
  
*Disclosure: These are my honest opinions on these products; I wouldn't praise
them if I didn't actually use and enjoy them. Members of Team Oregon do get a
nice discount on these products (regardless of whether we post about them or
not), but I receive no compensation or free products for this. I'm just showing
some love for our sponsors to encourage them to keep partnering with our team.*
