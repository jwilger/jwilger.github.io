For whatever reason, the combination of Toto, Heroku and/or my implementation
seems to cause every post here to have it's post-date updated to something
approximating the current date. Given that I haven't exactly been creating a
lot of content on this site lately (and lost years worth of posts not too long
ago), I hadn't noticed this problem until the other day. To be honest, I'm not
sure if I really feel like putting forth the effort to fix it given everything
else going on in my life these days.
  
Part of me wonders why I keep this site up and running at all. I tend to make
public statements in 140-character increments these days. Twitter has killed
the casual blog.
