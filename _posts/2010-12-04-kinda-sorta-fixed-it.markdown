I finally got fed up with the fact that the post dates were wrong (you know, for
the 3, pointless entries that were even here.) I also realized that I have no
desire to try to wedge my content into that stupid, liquid templates system. It
might be useful when you want non-programmers to edit a site's layout, but it's
too limiting when I could just use plain-old Ruby code.

So, I gave toto the boot and am hand-rolling something simple. Yes, I know there
are a few other weblog tools out there that would give me the simplicity of
editing locally in vim using a markdown-formatted file, but I guess I'm
suffering from a bit of not-invented-here at this point after trying a couple
and finding them severely flawed when it comes to the way I want to work with
them.

Frankly, I also needed an outlet for hacking on something that didn't have to be
useful to anyone other than myself. The amount of time I've been able to spend
just writing code had decreased substantially since I took on management of the
[ProjectDX](http://projectdx.com) team at the beginning of the year.

Now that posting isn't a complete pain in the rear *and* the dates will show up
correctly, I'm hoping I might actually bother to write a blog post once in a
while. Based on historical evidence, I wouldn't hold my breath if I were you.
