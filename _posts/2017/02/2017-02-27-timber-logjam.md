  On Saturday, I went on my first epic adventure ride of the year,
  the Timber Logjam.

On Saturday, I went on my first epic adventure ride of the year,
the [Timber Logjam][timber-logjam-rwgps]. It's an unsanctioned group ride with a
route put together by [unpaved+omtm][unpaved].

Apparently it's been too long since I've done any real gravel riding and big
climbs. I saw "50 miles" and thought "3-4 hours" based on what I'd be doing on
an easy road ride this time of year.

Ha! Six hours later, with several hills spent pushing my bike up while trying
not to collapse on my severely cramping quads, I realized I wasn't quite ready
for that yet this season (my longest rides otherwise this year have only been
maybe 2.5 hours or so with the exception of [one team ride][team-ride] that had
less than half of the elevation gain and was all paved.)

At about mile 28, my legs were completely done. If I put more than the barest
amount of force into the pedals, my quads seized up. For extra fun, if I tried
to put my foot down and stop, my quads also seized up. Well, since it was either
finish the ride or die in the woods, I just had to push through every agonizing
stroke of the pedals on the climb up to Carson Creek Rd. Thankfully my legs
eventually resigned to their lot, and the final 20 miles or so weren't quite so
agonizing.
