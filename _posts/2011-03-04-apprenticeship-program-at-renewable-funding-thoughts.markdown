The [Renewable Funding](http://renewfund.com) technology team is moving into
some new office space in a few months, and now that we'll have our own space,
I'd like to start up a variation on an apprenticeship program at work.  I'm
still in the early stages of designing this, and I want to gather some input
from the community before deciding how we might run the program.

<!-- more -->

My goals for this program are as follows:

  * Contribute back to the local and global software development communities by
    providing mentoring, a place to work, and stewardship of one or more
    open-source projects.

  * Provide a safe, open, fun environment for people of all backgrounds to
    improve their skill in a non-competitive, supportive learning environment.

  * Increase local knowledge about Renewable Funding's software development
    team, so that when we post job openings, you all know who we are.

  * Identify local developers who—while they may not have a lot of
    experience—have a lot of talent and passion, so that we know who to talk to
    when we have appropriate positions open up.

Here's what I'm thinking as a starting point, please let me know what might not
work, and what might work better:

  * Recruit a group of between 2 and 6 local developers who are interested in
    participating in the program for N months. (What is an appropriate time
    period?)

  * The group gets together at our office one evening per week for the duration
    of the term. (Thursdays from 4pm-8pm? Is once per week the right frequency?)

  * At least one senior developer from my team will be at each session to coach
    and mentor the team. Renewable Funding will pay for dinner and/or snacks.

  * The group will decide on an open source project to work on. It could be a
    new creation or contributions to an existing project.

  * The group will work on project following an agile methodology similar to
    what we employ during our daily work at Renewable Funding.

  * We *may* be able to open our office to participants during regular work
    hours to provide a space to work and access to individual mentoring.

So, is this a good idea? Would anyone be interested in this? Am I overlooking
some obvious and potentially disastrous outcome?
