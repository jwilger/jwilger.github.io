  <p>Dublin and I went for a mountain-bike ride on the Triple C and Gales Creek
  trails out of Reehers Camp this weekend, and encountered the most interesting
  thing I've ever seen on a bike ride.</p>
---

Dublin has been itching to get out on a good mountain bike ride for a while now,
but it's been hard to find a good day to do so, since he doesn't quite have the
gear to go riding in nasty weather (and that gear is too expensive to buy for
someone who will outgrow it within the year!) Finally, on Sunday, we were
blessed with the perfect mountain-biking weather, so we decided to get out
there.

The problem is that our usual spot, the trails up at Stub Stewart State Park
really suffered from the winter storms this year and are not yet cleared for
riding. Being relative noobs at mountain-biking, I wasn't sure where to go, so I
[solicited suggestions from the unpaved mailing list][ssuml]. Ultimately, we
decided to check out the [Triple C Trail][tct] and part of
the [Gales Creek Trail][gct] out of [Reehers Camp][rc].

Cochran Rd---the road out of Timber that leads to Reehers---is basically a giant
mud bog, which made it fun to get my low-slung Civic to the trail head parking
lot; thankfully a lot of the skills I learned while four-wheeling my old FJ are
applicable even to (even more to?) less-capable vehicles, and we made it with
nothing more than a single, cringe-worthy scraping down the middle of the car's
belly with some muddy gravel. It made me wonder how the trails would be, but it
turned out that the road was just about the only mud we would see. (From the
looks of a few of the worst spots on the road, I'd put the blame on the kind of
off-roading assholes that think it's fun to spin their truck tires in mud pits
and ruin the roads and 4x4 trails for everyone else.)

We started off with an anti-clockwise trip around Triple C. The beginning of the
trail was a bit hard to find thanks to some recent blow-down, but once past that
point, the rest of the trail was almost entirely rideable...if you were
careful. Pretty much all of the large blow-down was removed, but there was a lot
of smaller branches all over the trail just waiting to cause an inopportune
traction-loss or to snag a derailleur.

I wouldn't call the Triple C trail spectacular as a destination, but it was
nonetheless a fun, beginner-level trail with enough of a climb to be a nice
(part of) a workout and a good warm-up to the Gales Creek Trail (especially since
it loops around to a spot fairly close to the parking lot in case you realize
you forgot something at the car, which happens more than I'd like to admit.) The
end of the trail is a little nicer, as it follows along the north bank of the
Nehalem River.

After finishing the Triple C, we crossed the road and picked up the Gales Creek
Trail. The first part of the trail (up to its intersection with
the [Step Creek Trail][sct]) was in slightly worse condition than the Triple C,
but it was mostly rideable. This trail requires a *little* more skill than the
Triple C, but it's still pretty beginner-friendly. Some parts of the climb were
a little too much for Dublin (whose bike-weight is about a third of his
body-weight) and required some pushing, but not to the point where he didn't
enjoy it.

Not too far in to this part of the trail, we came across a really cool looking
skeleton:

It was pretty fresh; the bones looked like they had only been picked clean
within the last day or so, and they still had all the tendons connecting them
intact. The span of the limbs was about four or five feet. I'm not sure what
animal it came from, but it looked like there maybe were hooked claws at the end
of one of the limbs (missing on the other). I've never seen anything like that
before (in the wild), so this alone made our trip worthwhile. It's too bad my
sister wasn't there with something in which to collect this, as it would be
right up her alley.

When we got to the junction with the Step Creek Trail, we thought we'd try to
take that back to the parking lot, but the blow-down was really bad. We
encountered a group of hikers stopped on the trail having lunch, and they said
they had given up after trying to make it through and encountering a big snag
with no good way around it just a bit further down. We backtracked, hoping that
the double-track we had just crossed would similarly lead back to Cochran Rd,
but it dead-ended just a little further on. So we turner around and decided to
pick up the Gales Creek Trail just a little further south and then take it back
down to where we started. This more-southern section of the Gales Creek Trail
was not nearly as clear as the lower section, and it ended up being almost as
much hiking as biking.

Crossing the road back to the part of the Gales Creek Trail we had already come
up, we enjoyed a fun and fast descent back down to Cochran Rd and the parking
lot at Reehers.

It was a lot of fun to [explore some new trails][esnt], especially ones that are so
close to home. I look forward to checking out more of the Gales Creek Trail a
little later in the season, once it's been cleared (and we will probably see
about volunteering to help make that happen, too.) There was a volunteer crew
with a base-camp at Reehers, so they are actively working on this area.
