And in other exciting news, I found a bunch of my old blog posts archived in
Google Reader that go back to before I effed up and lost the repository that
this site used to be stored on. I'm going to add many of them back to the
archives. While I will go through and fix the egregious encoding errors, I'm
probably not going to restore old hyperlinks that are getting lost in the
cut-n-paste.
