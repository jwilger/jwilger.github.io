The big news in my life right now is that the company I work for just went
through a merger, so TSSI is no more, and [ProjectDX](http://projectdx.com) is
now part of [Renewable Funding](http://renewfund.com). I decided to accept the
offer presented by the new owners--and it came with a bit of a promotion--so
I am now Software Development Manager and responsible for guiding and growing
the Portland development team.

<!-- more -->

Thankfully, even though Renewable Funding is based in Oakland, CA, there are
no plans to move our team down there. We'll be staying in Portland and
continuing to work on the public-facing web application that provides
communities with tools to educate their residents about sustainability
programs and allow property owners to manage applications for
[PACE](http://renewfund.com/pace/definition-history) financing
programs.

I'm looking forward to figuring out my new role as I step into a management
position. Although I've always been a natural leader--I've served as
technical lead on various teams and held a lot of influence over team and
process design in my consulting work--this is the first time I've been
responsible for personnel management and had people reporting to me in the
org-chart. I don't pretend to know all there is to know about being a great
manager, but I have the benefit of some great mentors and a fantastic team to
start with. I've always done my best work when I'm thrown in just a bit over
my head, and this is definitely pushing my boundaries (especially when
combining the new responsibilities with navigating a merger).
