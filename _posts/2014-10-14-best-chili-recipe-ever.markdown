I've had a few requests to share this chili recipe from time to time; 
most likely because everyone who has ever had it subsequently decides it 
is the best chili they have ever had. Giving credit where it's due, this 
is based on Alton Brown's chili recipe from his book, [I'm Just Here for 
the Food] [IJHFTF], but modified to my own tastes. The sauce is rich and 
spicy, although it's a nice, even keel that doesn't get hotter and 
hotter with each bite.

*A word of warning:* I've gotten to the point where I throw this recipe 
together by feel and don't necessarily remember the exact measurements 
for some of this. Where I'm unsure, I've noted the ingredient as 
"(approx)". You may want to adjust them to taste.

## Hardware ##

* Well-seasoned 4-Quart Cast Iron Dutch Oven
* Stick Blender

## Ingredients ##

* 1 red bell pepper

* 1.25 lbs Beef Chuck Steak
* 1 tbsp kosher salt (approx)
* 1 tsp fresh ground black pepper (approx)
* 1 tbsp Chipotle chili powder (approx)
* 1/2 tsp ground cayenne pepper (approx)

* 2 tbsp olive oil

* 2 large yellow onions, chopped
* 2 large cloves of elephant garlic, chopped

* 2 cups beef broth (approx)
* 12 oz of *good* beer. (approx) No, this is not as subjective as you 
  think. If you use Budweiser or the like, I will hunt you down.
* 28 oz canned diced tomatoes
* 2 Chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (2 peppers, not 2 cans)
* 2 dried California chilies, seeds removed and cut into strips
* 2 dried Ancho chilies, seeds removed and cut into strips
* 2 squares of unsweetened baker's chocolate
* 2-3 drops of Da'Bomb Beyond Insanity (or some other hot sauce rated at 
  roughly 120,000 scoville units)

* 2-3 14 oz cans of kidney and/or black beans, drained and thoroughly 
  rinsed

* Tortilla chips
* Sour Cream
* Chives
* Shredded cheddar cheese

## Directions ##

1. Cut one red bell pepper in half, lengthwise; remove seeds and stem.

2. Place the red bell pepper halves in the oven, on the top rack, 
   skin-side up, and turn on the broiler until the skins are black.

3. Remove the red bell pepper from the oven using tongs, and place them 
   in an airtight container such as a resealable freezer bag.

4. Trim large sections of fat from 1.25 lbs of Beef Chuck Steak and then 
   cube the meat into small cubes (approximately 1/2" cubes). This is 
easier to do with a pair of kitchen scissors than with a knife. *DO NOT 
GRIND THE MEAT OR USE GROUND BEEF!*

5. Combine the 1 tbsp kosher salt, 1 tsp fresh ground black pepper, 1 
   tbsp Chipotle chili powder and 1/2 tsp ground cayenne pepper in a 
small dish.

6. In a large bowl, toss the cubed meat with the spice mixture to 
   thoroughly coat the meat.

7. Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a 4-quart cast iron dutch oven over 
   medium-high heat. It is warm enough when the oil shimmers, but it 
should not be smoking excessively at this point.

8. Add a small amount (less than 1/4 cup) of the meat to the dutch oven 
   and sear the meat (i.e. do not move it excessively) on all sides.

9. Remove the meat from the dutch oven and set it on a large plate until 
   cool enough to touch.

10. Taste the meat. It should be salty, though not overwhelmingly so, 
    and it should in the medium-hot spiciness range, whatever that means 
to you. If it is not spicy enough, toss the remaining, uncooked meat 
with more Chipotle powder and/or cayenne pepper. If it is too 
spicy...better luck next time.

11. Cook the remaining meat in batches small enough to maintain space in 
    the bottom of the pot between pieces of meat. This allows the meat 
to sear properly as opposed to just browning, as it doesn't become 
overwhelmed with moisture. You want the pieces to be almost crispy, but 
not burnt. Due to the spice on the meat, be sure to use a vent fan, and 
avoid breathing in the steam/smoke from the meat. You will be unhappy if 
you breathe that in. Once cooked, remove each batch from the dutch oven 
and set aside on the same large plate.

12. Under cold, running water, use your fingers to remove the blackened 
    skins from the red bell pepper halves.

13. Add the onions and garlic to the dutch oven, and saut√© until the 
    onions are soft and translucent.

15. Add the beef broth, beer, diced tomatoes, red bell pepper, Chipotle 
    peppers, California chilies, ancho chilies, baker's chocolate and 
hot sauce to the dutch oven, stir together, and bring the mixture to a 
boil.

16. Reduce the heat, cover with the lid, and simmer for 10 minutes.

17. Remove the dutch oven from the heat.

18. Using the stick blender right in the dutch oven, puree the mixture 
    until it forms a smooth sauce. Be sure to get the bottom and corners 
of the pot; there should be no chunks of anything when you are done. *Be 
careful! The sauce is quite hot in terms of both temperature and 
spiciness. Don't let it splash you while using the stick blender.*

19. Add the cooked meat and the beans to the pot and stir to combine, 
    adding more beef broth and/or beer as necessary to ensure that all 
beans and meat are submerged in the sauce without making it too soupy.

20. Set the oven temperature to 200 degrees Fahrenheit, place the dutch 
    oven in your oven, and let the chili braise for several hours; the 
longer, the better.

## To Serve ##

1. Crunch up a handful of tortilla chips in the bottom of each bowl.

2. Ladle chili on top of the tortilla chips.

3. Add a tablespoon or two of sour cream.

4. Cover with shredded cheese and garnish with chives.

5. Enjoy it with a good beer.
